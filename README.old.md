Suleiman:
Hi,

Completed the most important parts, and I think the web is ready for backend logic. However, the exact Williams College branding are not yet in effect and I was not able to figure out how to make them work. So, I will try my best to work on how that should be implemented (I can as well reach out to the OIT for official branding folders). Apart from that, I think everything else is fine and ready for backend.
